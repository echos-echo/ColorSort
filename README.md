<h2>Running/Opening the Game</h2>
<h3>*Note: game is currently incomplete in many functions</h3>
<div>
  Currently, ColorSort does not need any node packages, so no worries about installation or package versions<br>
  In order to open the game, either
  <ul>
    <li>Double-click index.html from the root directory on your desktop interface</li>
    <li>Run <code>npm run chrome</code> or <code>npm run safari</code> if either of those are your browser of choice, or <code>open index.html</code> to open it on your default browser</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>To-Do</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Click n Drag: Function/listener (mouseDown) to click on a color tile and move it from its current div/parent element</li>
    <li>Click n Drag: Function/listener (mouseUp) to let go of a color tile and have it appended where it is let go of</li>
    <li>Click n Drag: In addition to the mouseUp, color tile should be inserted where it is let go, and snap into position relative to its sibling elements</li>
    <li>Eventually, a win screen when a set of colors is successfully sorted</li>
  </ul>
</div>
